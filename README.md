  ## Description
  E-commerce-Back-End is a back end application used for creating tags for products and adding products to make a website function.

  ## Installation Instructions 
  Clone the repository via github. Then you would need to install [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) if you don't already have it. Once you have installed node.js, type npm install into the command line to install your node modules. You would also need to download MySql for database storage. Click [here](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/mysql/mysql-installation-guide) for a step by step on how to install and setup MySql. To test the application, download [insomniacore](https://insomnia.rest/download). Then you have to create the database via your Mysql called "ecommerce_db". After creating the database, you need to create a ".env" file that contains your ecommerce_db database along with your mysql user and password to allow sequelize to access the databases to generate tables.

  ## Usage Instructions
   Once you finish the downloads/installs required, go to the command line and type "npm start". Once started, open up insomnia core or which ever application you are using to test and create the routes to be tested.
